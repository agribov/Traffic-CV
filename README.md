This project is the mainframe computer application for the Traffic Light capstone project. 
It processes the thermal video coming from the Android device, and provides a user interface 
with which to interact with the data.

**// Go to MainWindow.cpp for all of the starter code to run the application:
  //		- MainWindow::onStart() contains the code to set up the app.
	//		- MainWindow::timerEvent() contains all of the code that runs tracking
	//		  and displays the results
	//		- These two functions are original code

	// MainWindow.h contains the class definition which contains the declarations of
	// all objects and variables used by the above functions

	// VehicleTracker.h defines the class which actively does the tracking (called by 
	// the above functions). VehicleTracker.cpp contains the class function definitions.
	// VehicleTracker references the Vehicle class (.cpp and .h). 
	//		- All four of these files are entirely original work.

	// CQtOpenCVViewerGl(.cpp and .h) contains the code to create a widget that displays
	// a cv::Mat object. These were not written by us (see files for references).
